# Problem Statement and Data Description
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

Handwritten digit recognition using neural network, trained on `60000` images from `MNIST dataset`.

# Requirements
Python 3.5 +
Scikit-Learn (latest version)
Numpy 
Matplotlib

# Accuracy
The model achieved an accuracy over 97.64% tested on `10000` images. It's built from scratch using PyTorch.
